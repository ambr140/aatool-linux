# Minecraft advancements tracker

https://ambr140.github.io/aatool-linux/

### Features:
- Show the total progress of all advancements
- Show finished criteria for complex advancements (e.g. for "A Balanced Diet" advancement)
- Doesn't require a server, works 100% in your browser

### Ideas/TODOs:
- Currently, supports only Minecraft Java 1.19, but it's easy to support older/newer versions
- It's possible to show the time when some advancement or criteria was finished. I can use it, just need to figure out how to make a nice UI
- Filter advancement by title is easy to do
- Offline mode
- Advancements JSON file also has unlocked recipes, so it's possible to track them
- Check if the Bedrock edition has a similar file, containing finished advancements
- Add share button (needs to figure out how to compact this huge JSON and add to URL)

### Limitation:
- When you finished a new advancement, you need to drag & drop the file again. Any ideas about automating this are appreciated
- There is a delay between finishing criteria (e.g. after eating a new type of food) and updating a JSON file in your world directory. To force save the JSON file, you can exit the world
- I have no idea how to do it for multiplayer servers. Any ideas are welcome
